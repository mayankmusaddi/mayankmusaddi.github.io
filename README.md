## PortFolio Website

This is my personal website created using jekyll and github-pages, taken from [portfolYOU](http://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) which is quite easily customizable and also has an easy to follow guided [documentation](https://youssefraafatnasry.github.io/portfolYOU/docs/).

### Execution Instruction

To run locally, make sure you have ruby and bundler installed and then execute the following lines:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To host it using github pages see [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/).
