# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a research student from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. My research focus being Bioinformatics, my primary work is based on data visualisation and analysis of dense biological data. With a strong apetite for learning, I have taken up projects in various domains like NLP, CV, GNNs, Deep Learning and Web Development.

**The above charts are indicative of nothing as after years of learning I have understood that proficiency in a language is worth nothing, what is matters in proficiency in concepts.
