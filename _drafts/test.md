Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  


Though wise men at their end know dark is right,  
Because their words had forked no lightning they  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  


Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  


Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,  
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  


Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight  
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  


And you, my father, there on the sad height,  
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  


â€” _Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953_

Fiction:
It was 4am, Sarthya lying in his bed still gazed at the dawning light peeping from behind the curtains veiling the rusty iron window. Nights often passed like this speculating the meaning and the worthlessness of life. Chaos outside to chaos inside
Hears a metal sound
He knows that his drunk father has come to hit him.
He will not look back or fear will grasp him and he will resist.
He looks forward wishing that this time it would kill him.
