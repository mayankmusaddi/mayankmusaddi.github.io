“In God we trust, all others must bring data” - W. Edwards Deming

Don't you feel lately, that the order of society has started to crumble? People get easily influenced and they start to trust the most influential rather than the most effective or just. 

The very essence of this truth was clearly reflected in the film ‘Ankhon Dekhi’ where the central character Bauji after finding some reality twisted by the society, takes a firm resolution on believing only on what he sees and wisely says “Apna Sach Dhoond (Find your own reality)”.
