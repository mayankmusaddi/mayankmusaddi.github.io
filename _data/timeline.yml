  description: ● Working as a research student under Prof. Nita Parekh
               ● Created NetREx, an end to end web application for data visualisation
               of dense networks of Gene Coexpression Data using Sigma JS, Express JS
               and Docker
               ● Currently focussed on using Graph Neural Networks for the analysis of
               such bioogical networks to get insights toward multi stress tolerant crops

  to: August 2021
  description: ● Created a pipeline for knowledge distillation of large models for
               language modelling task. Used it to distill large RoBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa
               models fine-tuned on Twitter specific data to smaller pretrained distilRoBERTa
               model which is half the size and twice as fast
               ● Created a web application to host and visualise models and datasets that is
               used by the Sprinklr AI team using Python Streamlit

  description: ● Automated data harvesting from live Football(Soccer) Match Telecast
               using ML with Python OpenCV, MATLAB and Flask. Data like player positions,
               team classification, types of passes and the location of ball and goal post was
               fetched from the match images
               ● Built the back-end to get top view of field from skewed offside camera image,
               using the concepts of Morphology and Homography

- title: Software Engineering Intern, IIITH Product Labs
  from: August 2018
  to: Mar 2019
  description: ● Built an end to end application for Document Scanning to automate
               data entry from handfilled form data
               ● Provided a UI for template creation of the form using Interact and React JS.
               The back-end used Go Lang and Python Flask. Data extraction used Python
               OpenCV and SIFT transformation and an OCR made using Tensorflow
